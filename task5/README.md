# ðŸ“Š Experience vs Salary Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project is part of my **Python Developer Internship** (Task 5) and focuses on analyzing the relationship between **Years of Experience** and **Salary** using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**.  
The goal is to load the dataset, perform exploratory analysis, and visualize the correlation between experience and salary.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** (data loading, cleaning, and analysis)
- **Matplotlib** (data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **File Name:** `experience_salary.csv`  
- **Rows:** 30  
- **Columns:** 2 (`Experience`, `Salary`)

## ðŸ“ˆ Analysis Performed
1. **Data Loading** using `pd.read_csv()`.
2. **Data Exploration** (`.head()`, `.shape()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`).
3. **Basic Statistics** of Experience and Salary.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Scatter plot of Experience vs Salary.
   - Line plot showing salary trends with experience.
